# Evaluating Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Management of Blood Pressure and Lipids in Patients With and at High Risk of Cardiovascular Disease

## Project description

Although cardiovascular disease (CVD), including heart attacks and strokes, is still the leading cause of death in the UK, the risk of clinical CVD events and death can be reduced by the identification and effective treatment of major risk factors such as high blood pressure (BP) and lipids (e.g. cholesterol).

Access to routine clinical care was dramatically disrupted during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patterns of attendance in primary care changed from March 2020 onwards as a consequence of this and we have recently found that patterns of drug prescribing and dispensing, including cardiovascular drugs, changed significantly in 2020. Although these changes in practice are likely to have had an influence on the nature of testing, treatment and control of major risk factors for CVD, the extent and potential impact of these changes is unknown.

We therefore propose to use routine healthcare records to examine patterns of BP and lipid testing in the general population and evidence for control of these risk factors (according to expert clinical guideline recommendations) in patients with CVD and at high risk of developing CVD. We will also examine whether differences in the quality of testing, diagnosis and control of risk factors are related to any particular patient characteristics (e.g. sex, socioeconomic status, common chronic conditions).

This work will be undertaken in close alignment with another recently approved CVD-COVID-UK project, examining changes in CVD drug prescribing during the same period. Considered together, these analyses will provide important insights into the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection and control of key modifiable CVD risk factors in the UK population. Outputs from these analyses will be used to model the potential consequences for future CVD events in the UK and help to identify where efforts could potentially be focused most effectively to address emerging gaps in the provision of preventive care..
